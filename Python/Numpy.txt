art =linspace(0,16) // if number of pieces is not defined it is consided as 50 pieces.


ary = arange(1,15,2) // step size is 2 

ar = logspace( 1, 40 ,5)  //it is same as linspace but logertemic  . here 10 raise to power of 1 to 10 raise to the power of 10 and divided into 5 parts.

arty= zeros(5 , int) //all zeros with array size as fine. ingeneral we will get float . data type specifies it as int.
arty= ones(5) // all ones with float
